It's a measure of the importance of a word in a document with respect to an entire corpus of documents. The idea behind TF-IDF is to give more weight to words that are rare or specific to a particular document, and less weight to words that are common across all documents.\n","\n","Here's how it works:\n","\n","1. Term frequency (TF): The term frequency is the number of times a word appears in a document, normalized by the total number of words in the document. The resulting value is a measure of the importance of a word within a single document.\n","\n","2. Inverse document frequency (IDF): The inverse document frequency is a measure of the rarity of a word across all documents in the corpus. It is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the word.\n","\n","3. TF-IDF: The final value for each word is obtained by multiplying its term frequency by its inverse document frequency. This results in a value that is high for words that are rare or specific to a particular document, and low for words that are common across all documents.\n","\n","The `TfidfVectorizer` class implements this method by first tokenizing the text data into individual words (or \"tokens\"), and then computing the TF-IDF values for each token in each document. The result is a sparse matrix of features, where each row represents a document and each column represents a word."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5ad10344","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.164996,"end_time":"2023-02-04T11:44:28.267424","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-02-04T11:44:28.102428","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["The
